## 📂 Repository Structure

* `RelADiff/`: Standalone directory of a python project containing model architectures, trainers, and the `run.py` entry point.
* `generative/`: Module dedicated to the generative components of the diffusion process.
* `checkpoints/`: Directory for pre-trained diffusion model weights.
* `discriminator_checkpoints/`: Directory for adversarial discriminator weights.

## 📊 Data Preparation

The model expects preprocessed 3D NIfTI brain images. Images should be co-registered to MNI space. A common pro-processing pipeline can be found [here](https://www.gaaindata.org/data/centiloid/Centiloid_Processing.docx).

Organize your data as follows:

```text
data_root/
  ├── 00001/             # subject ID
  │   ├── 00001_T1.nii   # Input Condition 1
  │   ├── 00001_T2.nii   # Input Condition 2
  │   ├── 00001_PBR.nii  # Target Ground Truth PBR
  │   ├── 00001_PIB.nii  # Target Ground Truth PIB
  │   └── 00001_TAU.nii  # Target Ground Truth TAU
  └── 00002/ ...
```

### 💡 Implementation Details

The default data loader in `RelADiff/data.py` is configured for **Multi-Tracer Consistency**. It filters for subjects with a complete set of modalities (T1, T2, PBR, PIB, TAU) to ensure a high-quality, balanced validation set.

#### **Using Incomplete Modalities?**

If your dataset does not have all five modalities for every subject, the validation pool will be empty. To bypass this:

* **Option A**: Reduce the `val_size` parameter in the config.
* **Option B**: Switch to a global subject pool for validation. We have provided a pre-commented Option B in `data.py`.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Running the Project)

You can run the entire pipeline (Preprocessing, Training, and Inference) using the convenience runner.

From the project root:

```bash
python run.py --mode all
```

*Alternatively, for interactive experimentation and visualization, refer to the [MRI_to_MultiTracer_PET_Synthesizing.ipynb](https://www.google.com/search?q=./MRI_to_MultiTracer_PET_Synthesizing.ipynb) notebook.*


The [TorchIO](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://torchio.readthedocs.io/) pipeline automatically handles cropping to $(160, 180, 160)$ and intensity normalization to $[-1, 1]$.
